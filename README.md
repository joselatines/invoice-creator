# Invoice APP

The Invoice Creator app streamlines the process of generating invoices by providing a user-friendly form to input customer and product information. Once filled, the app generates and displays the invoice on the page. Additionally, users have the option to save the invoices on a database managed by SQLite3 for convenient retrieval and management.

I developed this app during my time at a motorcycle parts store, where we faced challenges due to the lack of a proper invoice management system. Relying on an Excel file proved inefficient and hindered our ability to maintain accurate customer records, affecting our business operations.
